# PRD: Same-Day Delivery Fulfillment Platform for Local Muslim Fashion E-Commerce

**Status:** Active Enterprise Architecture
**Owner:** Wildan
**Last updated:** 14 August 2026

## 1. Background & Problem Statement

Local Muslim-fashion boutiques and e-commerce platforms (hijab, gamis, koko, mukena, etc.) frequently receive orders from buyers who need the item **on the same day** — for a *kondangan*, *pengajian*, or last-minute event. Today this is handled manually: WhatsApp order confirmations, Excel/Google Sheets for tracking, and phone calls to couriers. This causes:

- No single source of truth for order status between the merchant's warehouse staff, courier, and buyer.
- No guarantee mechanism for same-day SLA — orders silently slip to next-day delivery.
- Returns/exchanges (common in fashion — size, color mismatch) are tracked manually, causing inventory discrepancies.
- Multiple boutiques/brands share the same operator team (common in Indonesian fashion aggregator/reseller networks), risking **data leakage** between competing brands (order volume, buyer data, courier routes).

---

## 2. Goal

Build a Rails-based **Order Management System (OMS)** that gives boutique warehouse staff and merchant brand owners a real-time operational screen to:
1. See incoming orders that require same-day fulfillment, prioritized by cutoff time.
2. Print shipping labels/AWB per order with Code128 vector barcodes.
3. Track courier pickup → delivery status in real time via FleetPulse Elixir Radar.
4. Manage returns without leaking data across tenants (brands).
5. Configure merchant API credentials, SLA cutoff hours, and warehouse staff access.

## 3. Comprehensive User Role Matrix & Requirements

The platform serves **4 distinct operational user roles**, each requiring tailored capabilities:

| User Role | Persona & Access Scope | Dedicated Screen / Route | Specialized Features & Missing Scope Roadmap |
|---|---|---|---|
| **1. Warehouse Manager** | Executive Operations Lead (`Budi Hendra`, `Siti Nurhaliza`) | `/analytics`, `/settings`, `/orders`, `/support` | - **RBAC & Authentication**: User login (`/login`) with role permissions.<br>- **Emergency Halt**: Warehouse emergency override button.<br>- **Audit Log**: Digital trail of staff actions.<br>- **Cutoff Triage**: Override same-day SLA cutoff for VIP orders.<br>- **Staff Leaderboard**: Packing productivity per shift. |
| **2. Picker & Packer Staff** | Warehouse Physical Operations Staff | `/orders`, `/inventory`, `/manifests`, `/scan` | - **Bin Location Finder**: Physical bin mapping (`Rak A-01, Bin 12`).<br>- **JsBarcode Engine**: 100mm x 150mm thermal AWB sticker.<br>- **Handover PDF**: Printable Surat Jalan PDF.<br>- **PDA Barcode Mode (`/scan`)**: Camera/laser barcode scanning for hands-free pick/pack validation.<br>- **Wave Picking**: Batch route picking for 50 orders simultaneously.<br>- **Scale Check**: Digital weight scale validation. |
| **3. Brand Merchant** | E-Commerce Store Owner (`Boutique Hijab Premium`, `Gamis Elegant Style`) | `/settings`, `/inventory`, `/api/v1/orders` | - **Isolated Portal View**: Strict tenant isolation for merchant owners.<br>- **API Key Management**: Production API keys & Webhook URL configuration.<br>- **Marketplace Sync**: Real-time stock sync with Shopify/TikTok/Tokopedia.<br>- **Inbound PO (`/inbound`)**: Booking schedule for new stock arrival from factory. |
| **4. FleetPulse Courier** | Instant Delivery Driver (FleetPulse Elixir Cluster) | `/fleet_radar`, `/driver_app` | - **FleetPulse Radar (`/fleet_radar`)**: Live GPS telemetry stream (speed, ETA, coordinates).<br>- **Pickup Request**: Real-time dispatch trigger.<br>- **Driver Mobile PWA (`/driver_app`)**: Driver app to accept tasks & update status.<br>- **Proof of Delivery (POD)**: Photo attachment & digital signature on delivery. |

## 4. Core User Stories

1. As a **warehouse staff**, I want to see all orders due for same-day delivery sorted by cutoff time, so I can prioritize picking and packing.
2. As a **warehouse staff**, I want to print a shipping label directly from the order detail, so I don't need a separate system.
3. As a **merchant owner**, I want order and courier status to update live on the operational screen without refreshing, so my staff always has current information.
4. As an **operator managing multiple brands**, I want to be certain that switching to Brand A's dashboard never shows Brand B's orders, couriers, or buyer data.
5. As a **warehouse staff**, I want to register a return/exchange against an order, so inventory and refund status stay accurate.
6. As a **merchant owner**, I want to see how many orders missed the same-day SLA this week, so I can identify bottlenecks.
7. As a **warehouse manager**, I want an Emergency Halt button to pause automated courier dispatches during warehouse hardware or logistics outages.

## 5. Functional Requirements & Completed Modules

### 5.1 Module 1: Order Queue Pipeline (`/orders`)
- Connected pipeline stepper bar: `All Orders` → `1. Received` → `2. Packing` → `3. Packed` → `4. Dispatched`.
- 3-Column Glassmorphic Cards Grid matching **Obsidian Control** design system (`#0b1326`, `Outfit`, `Plus Jakarta Sans`, `JetBrains Mono`).
- **`+ New Manual Order`**: Glassmorphic modal form creating real DB records via `Orders::CreateOrderService` & `Orders::CreateOrderForm`.
- **`⚡ Filter Order Queue`**: Smooth slide-over drawer (`cubic-bezier` transition) with Date Range, SLA Urgency Multi-select, Status Grid, and Merchant filter.
- **`🚨 Emergency Halt`**: Instant warehouse override dispatch pause.

### 5.2 Module 2: FleetPulse Driver Radar (`/fleet_radar`)
- Live GPS telemetry stream (latitude, longitude, speed in km/h, ETA countdown, call driver action).
- Real-time driver status tracking for `dispatched`, `in_transit`, and `delivered` orders.

### 5.3 Module 3: Returns & Exchange Processing Hub (`/returns`)
- Customer return claims processing hub with interactive QA state machine buttons (`Mark Picked Up`, `Receive at Warehouse`, `Pass QA & Inspect`, `Resolve & Issue Exchange`).

### 5.4 Module 4: Inventory & Bin Location Finder (`/inventory`)
- Warehouse rack bin mapping (`Rak A-01, Bin 12`), 3-tier stock levels (Physical, Allocated, Available) derived dynamically from PostgreSQL `order_items.bin_location` records.

### 5.5 Module 5: SLA Compliance & Analytics Dashboard (`/analytics`)
- SLA On-time compliance rate (%), total active orders, overdue SLA violations, total GMV revenue, top selling fashion products ranking table.

### 5.6 Module 6: Batch Label Print & Driver Handover Manifest (`/manifests`)
- Printable A4 Surat Jalan Serah Terima Driver PDF (`/manifests/handover_pdf`) with dynamic manifest reference, package list, dual signature boxes, and vector Code128 barcode engine.

### 5.7 Module 7: Merchant & Warehouse Settings (`/settings`)

## 6. System Architecture & Strict Rules

### 6.1 Strict Engineering Directives (`AGENTS.md`)
- **No Direct Code Editing Rule**: AI agent outputs code in chat; user reviews and executes.
- **Strict Sorbet Typing (`# typed: strict`)**: All files under `app/` MUST start with `# typed: strict` and include complete `sig` annotations.
- **Strict Prohibition of Hardcoded Values**: No hardcoded dummy strings, IDs, or fallback URLs. All data is dynamically derived from PostgreSQL database records or environment parameters.
- **Demo Data Via Seeder Only**: All test/demo data populated strictly through `db/seeds.rb` using dynamic catalog matrices and calculation logic.
- **Strict Prohibition of Pseudo-Random & Dummy Math Fallbacks**: Generating fake metrics or latencies using `rand()` or modulo offsets is strictly prohibited. All metrics derived from real database records or MONOTONIC clock socket benchmarks (`Process.clock_gettime(Process::CLOCK_MONOTONIC)`).

---

## 7. Phased Expansion Roadmap

### Phase 1 — Core OMS & Design System (COMPLETED ✅)
- Multi-tenant architecture, 8 enterprise modules, vector Code128 barcode engine, Obsidian Control design system, logic-driven seeder, and Sorbet strict type-safety.

### Phase 2 — Role Access Control & Mobile PDA Scan (UPCOMING 🚀)
- **Role-Based Authentication (`/login`)**: Devise / Session RBAC for Manager vs Staff vs Merchant.
- **PDA Mobile Barcode Scanner Mode (`/scan`)**: Camera/laser barcode scanning interface for hands-free pick/pack validation.
- **Driver Mobile Web App (`/driver_app`)**: Driver task acceptance & Proof of Delivery (POD photo) attachment.

### Phase 3 — Advanced Warehouse Logistics (FUTURE 🔮)
- **Wave Picking Engine**: Batch route optimization for 50+ orders.
- **Inbound Stock Booking (`/inbound`)**: Advanced Shipping Notice (ASN) for factory shipments.
- **Marketplace Auto-Sync**: Webhook engine for TikTok Shop, Shopify, and Tokopedia.
